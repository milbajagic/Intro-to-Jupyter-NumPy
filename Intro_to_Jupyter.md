# Intro-to-Jupyter
##### Jupyter Notebooks are a powerful way to write and iterate on your Python code for data analysis. [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/index.html) isn’t a different programming language, it’s just a set of computer programs for working with the Python language. Having said that, having python is a prequisite for working with Jupyter Notebook.
## To istall Jupyter:
##### * install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which is a free bundled installer of Python together with many other useful tools (including Jupyter Notebook and other libraries like matplotlib) 
##### * if you already have python installed and feel confortable with it, you can install Jupyter (plus matplotlib) using Python's package manager ‘pip’ as follows:
##### for Python3
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
##### for python2.7
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter
